# e-cedi App 

This is an Expo React Native App developed by me.

Dependencies: TailwindCSS | Animatable | Stack Navigation |

I will integrate Paystack into the project, this is a Fin-Tech app and i am building this as my Demo Day Project for my School (Codetrain Africa).

Users of this app will be able to send money to each other, pay utility bills, government tax and pay School fees. Fun part of it is the ability to create Saving Plans. Users will be able to create plans, put money into the plan and locked the plan for a period of time.
More to come, Enjoy..
